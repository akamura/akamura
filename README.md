## Hi! Hola! Olá! 你好! नमस्ते! مرحبا! Привет!
Hi there! I’m a passionate technologist and dedicated open‑source advocate. 
I love creating or collaborating on projects that turn bold ideas into reality and I believe that experimenting with an open dialogue and sharing for growth are at the heart of innovation.

Outside of code, you’ll find me:
- 🍔 Savoring traditional dishes or cooking them
- ✈️ Exploring new destinations around the globe
- 🗣️ Engaging in lively conversations that bring fresh perspectives to the table

These experiences sharing a meal, swapping stories, discovering cultures, mirror the collaborative spirit of the open‑source community: diverse voices coming together to inspire and uplift one another.
